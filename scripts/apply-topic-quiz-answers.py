        r"The ideal gas law \(pV=nRT\) applies to gases behaving ideally (low density, high temperature relative to condensation point). The first law \(\Delta U=Q-W\) applies to a defined system with \(W\) as work done <em>by</em> the system. State which model you are using before substituting.",
        r"A common error is mixing °C with kelvin in gas-law calculations — \(T\) must be in kelvin. Another is confusing heat \(Q\) with temperature. Convert to SI and use absolute temperature before substitution.",
        r"\(Q=mc\Delta T\), where \(Q\) is heat energy transferred (J), \(m\) is mass (kg), \(c\) is specific heat capacity (J kg\(^{-1}\) K\(^{-1}\)), and \(\Delta T\) is temperature change (K).",
        r"For \(pV=nRT\), pressure in Pa and volume in m\(^3\) give energy-consistent units with \(R=8.31\) J mol\(^{-1}\) K\(^{-1}\). Using kPa with cm\(^3\) without conversion introduces powers-of-ten errors.",
        r"When measuring specific heat capacity, insulate the sample to reduce heat loss to surroundings, stir for even temperature, take repeat readings of temperature rise, and start timing when heating begins.",
        r"Check \(\Delta U=Q-W\) sign conventions match the question wording. For an ideal gas isothermal process, \(\Delta T=0\) implies \(\Delta U=0\) so \(Q=W\). Specific heat values should match tabulated orders of magnitude (e.g. water \(c\approx4200\) J kg\(^{-1}\) K\(^{-1}\)).",

    "capacitors.html": [
        r"Capacitance \(C=Q/V\) defines the charge–voltage relation for a given capacitor geometry. Discharge \(Q=Q_0 e^{-t/RC}\) applies to an RC circuit with constant \(R\) and \(C\). State whether the capacitor is charging or discharging before using the exponential form.",
        r"Students often forget that \(Q\) on a capacitor refers to charge on one plate, or use mF/µF inconsistently with seconds and ohms in the time constant \(\tau=RC\). Convert all units to SI before finding \(\tau\).",
        r"\(E=\frac{1}{2}CV^2\), where \(E\) is energy stored (J), \(C\) is capacitance (F), and \(V\) is potential difference across the capacitor (V).",
        r"\(\tau=RC\) requires \(R\) in ohms and \(C\) in farads to give time in seconds. Mixing µF with k\(\Omega\) without converting produces time constants wrong by \(10^9\).",
        r"Measure voltage at regular time intervals during discharge, keep circuit connections stable, discharge through a fixed resistor, and repeat the run to check the exponential trend is consistent.",
        r"After one time constant, voltage should fall to \(\approx37\%\) of \(V_0\). Stored energy should be positive and scale as \(V^2\). If \(Q\) increases while discharging, sign or circuit polarity has been misapplied.",

        r"A common error is adding magnitudes directly when vectors are not collinear — \(|\vec{A}+\vec{B}|\neq|\vec{A}|+|\vec{B}|\) in general. Resolve into components, add components, then find resultant magnitude.",
        r"\(|\vec{A}|=\sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2}\), where \(A_x\) and \(A_y\) are perpendicular components (same units as the vector, e.g. m s\(^{-1}\) for velocity).",
        r"Component values must use the same unit in each axis (e.g. both m s\(^{-1}\)). Mixing km h\(^{-1}\) with m s\(^{-1}\) in \(A_x\) and \(A_y\) gives a meaningless resultant magnitude.",

    "nuclear-physics.html": [
        r"Exponential decay \(N=N_0 e^{-\lambda t}\) assumes a large number of nuclei and constant decay probability per nucleus. Half-life \(T_{1/2}=\ln 2/\lambda\) is valid for this random decay model.",
        r"Students confuse activity \(A\) (decays per second, Bq) with the number of nuclei \(N\), or use minutes for \(t\) while \(\lambda\) is in s\(^{-1}\). Convert time to seconds before substitution.",
        r"\(A=\lambda N\), where \(A\) is activity (Bq), \(\lambda\) is decay constant (s\(^{-1}\)), and \(N\) is the number of undecayed nuclei.",
        r"Activity is measured in becquerels (s\(^{-1}\)). If \(\lambda\) is in yr\(^{-1}\) but \(t\) is in seconds, the exponent \(\lambda t\) will be wrong by orders of magnitude.",

    ],
    "particle-physics-intro.html": [
        r"The relativistic energy–momentum relation \(E^2=(pc)^2+(mc^2)^2\) applies to individual particles. Conservation laws (charge, baryon number, lepton number) must hold in every allowed interaction — state which laws you are checking.",
        r"A common error is treating kinetic energy as \(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\) for particles moving near the speed of light. Use relativistic relations when \(v\) is an appreciable fraction of \(c\).",
        r"\(E^2=(pc)^2+(mc^2)^2\), where \(E\) is total energy (J), \(p\) is momentum (kg m s\(^{-1}\)), \(m\) is rest mass (kg), and \(c\) is the speed of light (m s\(^{-1}\)).",
        r"Mass–energy calculations require SI units. Rest energy \(mc^2\) in joules uses kg for mass. Mixing MeV with SI units without conversion causes scale errors.",
        r"In particle-track analysis, calibrate detector scale from known references, measure track curvature consistently, and account for energy loss in the medium before inferring momentum.",
        r"Check conserved quantities balance on both sides of a reaction. Total charge, baryon number, and lepton number should each sum to the same value before and after. Annihilation products must include both particle and antiparticle where required.",

    "mathematical-methods-physics.html": [
        r"Kinematic relations \(v=\mathrm{d}x/\mathrm{d}t\) and \(a=\mathrm{d}^2x/\mathrm{d}t^2\) apply when \(x(t)\) is differentiable. Linearisation \(\log y=n\log x+\log k\) applies when a power law \(y=kx^n\) is assumed.",
        r"Rounding too early in multi-step differentiation or gradient calculations distorts final values. Keep extra significant figures through intermediate steps and round only at the end.",
        r"\(y=mx+c\), where \(y\) is the dependent variable, \(m\) is gradient (change in \(y\) per unit \(x\)), \(x\) is the independent variable, and \(c\) is the intercept.",
        r"Gradient calculations require consistent units on both axes (e.g. m s\(^{-1}\) on \(y\) vs s on \(x\) gives gradient in m s\(^{-2}\)). Mixing axis units invalidates the physical meaning of \(m\).",
        r"When finding a gradient from a graph, use a large triangle spanning multiple data points, read axes accurately, and repeat the gradient estimate from different point pairs.",
        r"Differentiated velocity should have units one power of time below displacement (e.g. m s\(^{-1}\) from \(x\) in m). A power-law gradient \(n\) from \(\log\)-\(\log\) plots should be constant across the fitted range.",
    ],
    "mechanics-a-level.html": [
        r"SUVAT equations apply only for <strong>constant acceleration</strong> along a straight line. Newton's second law \(\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}\) applies in an inertial frame with net force causing acceleration in the same direction as \(\vec{a}\).",
        r"Students often use SUVAT when acceleration is not constant, or omit the negative sign when decelerating. Define positive direction first and keep signs consistent for \(u\), \(v\), \(a\), and \(s\).",

        r"In dynamics experiments, repeat timing measurements, minimise friction where possible, keep release height consistent, and use light gates or video analysis for more reliable velocity data.",
        r"Check \(v^2=u^2+2as\) gives positive \(v^2\) for real motion. For free fall near Earth, \(a\approx9.8\) m s\(^{-2}\). Momentum and energy answers should be consistent with the same sign convention.",

        r"Centripetal acceleration \(a_c=v^2/r\) points toward the centre of the circle. It applies when speed \(v\) is instantaneous tangential speed and \(r\) is radius of the circular path. Identify which real force provides the centripetal force.",
        r"Students confuse centripetal force with a separate 'outward' force. Only real forces (tension, friction, gravity components) provide \(F_c=mv^2/r\) inward — there is no centrifugal force in the rotating frame analysis at A-Level.",
        r"\(F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}\), where \(F_c\) is centripetal force (N), \(m\) is mass (kg), \(v\) is speed (m s\(^{-1}\)), and \(r\) is radius (m).",
        r"Radius must be in metres. Using cm for \(r\) makes required force wrong by \(10^4\). Speed must be tangential speed, not angular speed — convert using \(v=\omega r\) if needed.",
        r"When measuring centripetal force practically (e.g. whirling bung), repeat timing for several revolutions, measure radius to the centre of mass of the object, and keep the plane of motion horizontal.",
        r"Centripetal force magnitude should increase with \(v^2\) and decrease with \(r\). Direction must point toward the centre. For a conical pendulum, resolve tension to confirm \(T\sin\theta=mv^2/r\).",
    ],
    "electric-fields.html": [
        r"Coulomb's law applies to point charges in vacuum (or uniform medium with permittivity). \(E=F/q\) defines field at a point using a small test charge. \(E=V/d\) applies only to a <strong>uniform</strong> field between parallel plates.",
        r"Students use \(E=V/d\) for radial fields around a point charge, or forget that force direction depends on charge sign (attraction vs repulsion). State whether the field is uniform before choosing the equation.",

        r"Charge in coulombs and distance in metres give force in newtons. Using cm for \(r\) in Coulomb's law changes force by \(10^4\). Field strength from \(E=V/d\) needs \(d\) in metres and \(V\) in volts.",
        r"In field-mapping experiments, keep electrode geometry fixed, avoid moisture on plates, repeat potential readings, and ensure the probe does not disturb the field being measured.",
        r"Like charges repel, unlike charges attract. Field lines point from positive to negative. For a uniform field, \(E\) should be constant between parallel plates; \(F=qE\) direction follows test charge sign.",
    ],
    "simple-harmonic-motion.html": [
        r"SHM requires acceleration proportional to displacement and directed toward equilibrium: \(a=-\omega^2 x\). The sinusoidal solution \(x=A\cos(\omega t+\phi)\) applies when damping is negligible and amplitude is small enough for the restoring model.",
        r"Students forget the negative sign in \(a=-\omega^2 x\), or confuse angular frequency \(\omega\) (rad s\(^{-1}\)) with frequency \(f\) (Hz). Use \(T=2\pi/\omega\) and \(\omega=2\pi f\) consistently.",

        r"Displacement and amplitude must be in metres, \(\omega\) in rad s\(^{-1}\), giving acceleration in m s\(^{-2}\). Using degrees instead of radians in \(\cos(\omega t)\) breaks the phase calculation.",

        r"Angles must be in degrees or radians consistently within the sine function — calculators in degree mode for geometry problems. Refractive index is dimensionless; only ratios of speeds matter in \(n=c/v\).",
        r"Pin optics apparatus securely, repeat image distance measurements, use a darkened room for sharp images, and measure object and image distances from the lens centre.",
        r"Light bends toward the normal when entering a denser medium (\(n_2>n_1\)). Magnification should be consistent with image size ratio. For total internal reflection, check \(\theta_i>\theta_c\) where \(\sin\theta_c=n_2/n_1\).",
