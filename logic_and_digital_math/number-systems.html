      <h2>Logic Gates</h2>
      <p>Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions like AND, OR, and NOT using binary inputs and outputs. Each gate implements a simple Boolean function.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Truth Tables</h2>
      <p>Truth tables list all possible input combinations to a logic circuit and their corresponding outputs. They are used to fully describe the behavior of Boolean expressions and digital logic systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Boolean Algebra</h2>
      <p>Boolean Algebra is a mathematical system used to represent and simplify logic circuits. It operates on binary values (0 and 1) and uses operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to manipulate logical statements.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DeMorgan's Laws</h2>
      <p>DeMorgan's Laws are transformation rules in Boolean algebra that show how to express AND operations using OR and NOT (and vice versa). These are key to simplifying logic expressions and designing circuits.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS)</h2>
      <p>SOP and POS are standard forms of expressing Boolean functions. SOP combines multiple AND operations with ORs, while POS does the opposite. These formats help in systematic circuit design and simplification.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Logic Simplification</h2>
      <p>Logic simplification involves reducing Boolean expressions to their simplest forms, minimizing the number of logic gates needed. This improves circuit efficiency and performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Karnaugh Mapping (K-Map)</h2>
      <p>A Karnaugh Map is a visual tool used for simplifying Boolean expressions. It organizes truth table values into a grid format that makes it easier to identify common patterns and eliminate redundant terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Quine–McCluskey Algorithm</h2>
      <p>The Quine–McCluskey algorithm is a tabular method for simplifying Boolean expressions. It is suitable for automation and handles more variables than Karnaugh Maps, though it is more computationally intensive.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hazards in Logic Circuits</h2>
      <p>Hazards are unwanted fluctuations in output caused by changes in input signals. They are classified into static, dynamic, and functional hazards and can lead to incorrect or unstable circuit behavior.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Finite State Machines (FSMs)</h2>
      <p>FSMs are abstract models of computation used to design sequential logic. They consist of a finite number of states, transitions based on inputs, and outputs, useful in control systems and embedded design.</p>
